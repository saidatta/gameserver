This is going to be a tool for assisting those who run tabletop RPGs. It will allow game masters to create campaign and game information and then to use it while running a game. Players of the game will also have tools available to assist during game play. 

The app uses mongoDB, Java, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Thymeleaf, JQuery, and Font Awesome. 

It will manage users permissions and access to pages and methods via Spring Security.
